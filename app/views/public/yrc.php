                <p class="text-left">Youth Red Cross programs is one of the most integral part of the strategic approach taken by the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) which is a voluntary humanitarian organization to protect human life and health based in India.  Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) was established in 1920 under the Indian Red Cross Society Act and incorporated under the Parliament Act XV of 1920 (as Amended by Act No. 22 of 1956 and the Adaptation of Laws (No. 4) order of 1957 and the Act. No. 14 of 1992). It is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and so shares the Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  The Mission of the Indian Red Cross Society is to inspire, encourage and initiate at all times all forms of humanitarian activities so that human suffering can be minimized and even prevented and thus contribute to creating more congenial climate for peace. This provides relief at the times of disasters/emergencies, and also promoting health & care of vulnerable people. </p>
                <p class="text-left">Youth Red Cross helps the students to inculcate discipline in them and to understand their responsibilities towards their countrymen, especially the poor and downtrodden. We in our college, have a Youth Red Cross wing. Any student of any discipline can become a YRC member. Our YRC unit is under the guidance of a programme officer.</p>
