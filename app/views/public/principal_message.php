P. J. Abdul Kalam: &ldquo;My message, especially to young people is to have courage to think differently, courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path, courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed. These are great qualities that they must work towards. This is my message to the young people.&rdquo;</li><br /><br /><li>Let me conclude my message with Ayya&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Have an ear for good; it will work for your ambitious bloom.&rdquo;</li></p>
